queues = Code
queues.announcement_id = Annuncio Agente
queues.announcement_id.tooltip = An announcement may be specified which is played to the agent as soon as they answer a call, typically to indicate to them which queue this call should be answered as, so that agents or members who are listening to more than one queue can differentiated how they should engage the customer.
queues.announce_frequency = Frequenza di Annunciare
queues.announce_frequency.placeholder = Valore in secondi
queues.announce_frequency.tooltip = Definisce la frequenza con cui dovremmo annunciare la posizione del chiamante e / o il tempo di attesa stimato in coda. Impostare questo valore su zero per disabilitare. In un call center di piccole dimensioni, è improbabile che il sistema sia in grado di effettuare stime accurate, pertanto i chiamanti hanno maggiori probabilità di trovare queste informazioni frustranti.

queues.announce_position.no.tooltip = The position will never be announced
queues.announce_position.tooltip = Defines whether the caller's position in the queue should be announced to her. If you have any logic in your system that can promote callers in rank (i.e., high-priority calls get moved to the front of the queue), it is best not to use this option. Very few things upset a caller more than hearing that theyâ€™ve been moved toward the back of the line.

queues.autofill.tooltip = The old behavior of the queue (autofill=no) is to have a serial type behavior in that the queue will make all waiting callers wait in the queue even if there is more than one available member ready to take calls until the head caller is connected with the member they were trying to get to.
queues.autopause = Autopause
queues.autopause.all = Tutto
queues.autopause.no = No
queues.autopause.tooltip = Enables/disables the automatic pausing of members who fail to answer a call. Select "All" to mark this member as paused in all queues. This parameter can be tricky in a live environment, because if the agent doesn't know they've been paused, you could end up with agents waiting for calls, not knowing they've been paused. Never use this unless you have a way to indicate to the members that they've been paused, or have a supervisor who is watching the status of the queue in real time.
queues.autopause.yes = Si

queues.timeoutpriority = Timeout Priority
queues.timeoutpriority.app = App
queues.timeoutpriority.conf = Conf
queues.timeoutpriority.tooltip = Used to control the priority of the two possible timeout options specified for a queue. The Queue() application has a timeout value that can be specified to control the absolute time a caller can be in the queue. The timeout value in queues.conf controls the amount of time (along with retry) to ring a member for. Sometime these values conflict, so you can control which value takes precedence.
